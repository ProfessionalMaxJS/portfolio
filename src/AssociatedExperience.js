        <div style={{position:"relative", left:"0.5vw", width:"99%"}} >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aided with deployment, as well as writing additional copy/content/etc, for this brick&amp;mortar shop; a vintage/antiques store held out of a ground floor garage of a Chelsea, Manhattan. Using the WIX platform, and following the work of previous content creators, I was able to streamline the available material into a leaner product for quicker deployment. Focusing less on e-commerce, and more on the unique kinds of items available at the store (as well as the unique culture on display inside the space itself), I was able to fill in pieces missing from what was already on display to get the website up and running. Web traffic, social media and general outreach/foot traffic have all indicated the results of publishing the site: successful!</div>

        <div style={{position:"relative", left:"0.5vw", width:"99%"}} > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my final projects in College were written papers. But, this many years later, the one that stands out the most is this video project: a mashup of different scenes from the 1933 classic "King Kong," overlaid with text to introduce other ideas, events and attractions from the era of the film's release. Spoiler alert: despite its own problems, the film itself has aged much better than some of its highly problematic contemporaries. Although this wasn't particularly a capsotone project, it managed to combine many of my academic interests in one project, as well as allow me to explore/learn some new skills. For example, the overlap of American history and American social, political and popular culture, has always fascinated me. While it is incredibly powerful to read about those overlaps, when the overlap in question revolves around a film, being alble to display it, and let it speak for itself, felt like a potent blend of intellect and artistry. To that end, despite consuming many movies in my Cinema Studies classes (and intellectually understanding the importance of the editor), I had never done any video editing myself (nor felt the consequences of getting it 'wrong'). Putting myself in those shoes was a captivating and rewarding experience in its own right. Looking back, it was really only possible thanks to NYU's bank of video editing computers, and that lab's 'all night access' policy. All these years later, thanks to the magic of the YouTube preservative, I am grateful to have this platform to share it - my one and only film credit - with you. I hope you enjoy! </div>
